    <h2>Reasons You Should Learn Web Development</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Now Hiring! There Are Web Dev Jobs Available</li>
      <p>
        Given that there will be approximately 1.4 million computing jobs
        available in 2020, with only 400,000 qualified developers to fill them,
        those interested in acquiring in-demand skills can certainly benefit
        from having web development and coding in their resume. It’s safe to say
        there is, and will continue to be, high demand for web developers. You
        won't have to worry about finding jobs for web developers any time soon.
      </p>

      <li>A Great Income</li>
      <p>
        According to U.S. News & World Report, certified professional web
        developers earn an average salary of $64,970 nation wide. Salary
        shouldn’t be the only factor when deciding whether or not to learn web
        development, but it should be taken into consideration. With the average
        household income in the United States being $56,516 in 2017, average
        income for web developers looks pretty nice.
      </p>

      <li>No Wasted Time in Learning How to Code</li>
      <p>
        If you’re serious about learning how to code, there are several options
        for web dev education. You can do a CS degree, teach yourself online, or
        do a bootcamp. All are great options; it really depends on how quickly
        you want to get out into the workforce. The benefit of bootcamp is that
        you can know how to code, and code well, in 13 weeks. 13 weeks! It’s an
        intense 13 weeks, but you will have people dedicated to your success in
        learning and finding a job throughout your bootcamp experience. Before
        you know it, you’ll be in a career you’re finally excited about!
      </p>

      <li>You Can Work From Anywhere</li>
      <p>
        Have freedom to work whenever you want from wherever—imagine that. All
        you need for web development is the internet and a laptop. Not all jobs
        are remote, but if that is your preference, there are remote jobs out
        there for you.
      </p>

      <li>You Can Work at an Awesome Tech Company</li>
      <p>
        Tech is where to be right now. Because there is such a high demand for
        web developers and so little trained developers to fill those positions,
        tech companies are doing an excellent job at making work like very
        comfortable, if not enjoyable. If you choose to work for a tech company
        as a web developer, you’ll enjoy free food, ping pong, and rad
        coworkers.
      </p>

      <li>There Are Always Freelance Opportunities</li>
      <p>
        If you’re the type that likes to work project to project on your own
        terms, then being a freelance web developer is for you. Once you join
        the web dev community, you will find that there are plenty of
        opportunities for you to freelance. Coming right out of bootcamp, you
        can charge $50 an hour—depending on where you live—for your work. And,
        that will only increase as you become more skilled.
      </p>

      <li>It's Creative and Fun</li>
      <p>
        Web development gives you the opportunity to express yourself creatively
        on the internet. If you have an idea you would like to try as you
        discover your web dev skills, try it out. Web dev is a fun, creative
        experience. Deciding a career will always be a difficult decision,
        especially when you’re unsure of what the outcome will be after you’ve
        invested time and money into learning a new trade. Fortunately, the high
        demand, easy-to-learn, fun-to-experience life of a web developer is
        always a great choice for someone ready to have an exciting career in
        code.
