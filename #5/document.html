  <h2>We Need a Common Language to Talk About It</h2>
  <p>
    In my latest book, The Practice of Groundedness, I traced this general
    sense of dis-ease to a concept I called heroic individualism: an ongoing
    game of oneupmanship against yourself and others where the goalpost is
    always ten-yards down the field. Heroic individualism is a vicious
    spiral of go, go, go; more, more, more; nothing is ever enough. It is
    striving unhinged, the result of which is a frantic and frenetic
    lifestyle overflowing with busyness, restlessness, loneliness, and,
    eventually, emptiness. I argued that the root problem of heroic
    individualism is that we fail to properly ground ourselves with a solid
    foundation of habits and practices in our lives.
